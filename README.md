## Questions:
1. How does your solution perform?
2. How does your solution scale?
3. What would you improve next?

## Answers
1.
- I'm using create-react-app command so it will take advantage of pre-configuaration and optiomize from the package. 
2.
- Typescript also is great choise for type checking and error proof.
- Structure project files by feature.
- Use redux-saga and recompose to have readable and testable asynchronous flows, tie together your decoupled components.

3. I’m working on improving in state management , performance and architecture. So I’m trying to go from ‘good’ to ‘great’ in these areas.
